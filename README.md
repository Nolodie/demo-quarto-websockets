demo-quarto-websockets
======================

This is an exercise in Golang, as well as the basic web languages(HTML/HTML5, CSS/CSS3, Javascript, JQuery).


The two major goals of this exercise are to model a board game, in this case "Quarto!", and a chatroom.

1. "Quarto!"
  
  DESCRIPTION:

  Quarto is a two player board game that includes 16 pieces. The goal of the game is to be the first player to either place 4 pieces with at least 1 attribute in common. Each piece has a combination of the following attributes: short/tall, dark/light, square/circle, solid/hollow. Game play follows the basic pattern of player "a" choosing a piece for player "b" to place and player "b" placing it on the board, and vice versa.


2. Chatroom
